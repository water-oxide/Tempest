			<p class="verseline">The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</p>
			<p class="verseline">With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dash’d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Had I been any god of power, I would</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</p>

			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">No harm.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have done nothing but in care of thee,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</p>

			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">More to know</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did never meddle with my thoughts.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis time</p>
			<p class="verseline">I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And pluck my magic garment from me. So,</p>
			<p class="verseline"><span class="stage_directions_inline">[Lays down his mantle]</span></p>
			<p class="verseline">Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d</p>

			<p class="verseline">I have with such provision in mine art</p>
			<p class="verseline">So safely ordered that there is no soul-</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, not so much perdition as an hair</p>
			<p class="verseline">Betid to any creature in the vessel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sit down, for thou must now know farther.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">You have often</p>
			<p class="verseline">Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And left me to a bootless inquisition,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Concluding ‘Stay; not yet.’</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">The hour’s now come;</p>
			<p class="verseline">The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</p>
			<p class="verseline">A time before we came unto this cell?</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do not think thou canst; for then thou wast not</p>
			<p class="verseline">Out three years old.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Certainly, sir, I can.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">By what? By any other house, or person?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of any thing the image, tell me, that</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath kept with thy remembrance?</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis far off,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And rather like a dream than an assurance</p>
			<p class="verseline">That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</p>
			<p class="verseline">Four, or five, women once, that tended me?</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</p>
			<p class="verseline">That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</p>
			<p class="verseline">In the dark backward and abysm of time?</p>
			<p class="verseline">If thou rememb’rest aught, ere thou cam’st here,</p>
			<p class="verseline">How thou cam’st here thou mayst.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">But that I do not.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and</p>
			<p class="verseline">A prince of power.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, are not you my father?</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</p>
			<p class="verseline">She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir</p>
			<p class="verseline">And princess no worse issued.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, the heavens!</p>
			<p class="verseline">What foul play had we that we came from thence?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or blessed was’t we did?</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Both, both, my girl.</p>
			<p class="verseline">By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But blessedly holp hither.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, my heart bleeds</p>
			<p class="verseline">To think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio-</p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray thee, mark me that a brother should</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be so perfidious. He, whom next thyself</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put</p>
			<p class="verseline">The manage of my state; as at that time</p>
			<p class="verseline">Through all the signories it was the first,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</p>
			<p class="verseline">In dignity, and for the liberal arts</p>
			<p class="verseline">Without a parallel, those being all my study-</p>
			<p class="verseline">The government I cast upon my brother</p>
			<p class="verseline">And to my state grew stranger, being transported</p>
			<p class="verseline">And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dost thou attend me?</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, most heedfully.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Being once perfected how to grant suits,</p>
			<p class="verseline">How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who</p>
			<p class="verseline">To trash for over-topping, new created</p>
			<p class="verseline">The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ‘em,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else new form’d ‘em; having both the key</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state</p>
			<p class="verseline">To what tune pleas’d his ear; that now he was</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ivy which had hid my princely trunk</p>
			<p class="verseline">And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, good sir, I do!</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray thee, mark me.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</p>
			<p class="verseline">To closeness and the bettering of my mind</p>
			<p class="verseline">With that which, but by being so retir’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother</p>
			<p class="verseline">Awak’d an evil nature; and my trust,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Like a good parent, did beget of him</p>
			<p class="verseline">A falsehood, in its contrary as great</p>
			<p class="verseline">As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Not only with what my revenue yielded,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But what my power might else exact, like one</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who having into truth, by telling of it,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Made such a sinner of his memory,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To credit his own lie-he did believe</p>
			<p class="verseline">He was indeed the Duke; out o’ th’ substitution,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And executing th’ outward face of royalty</p>
			<p class="verseline">With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dost thou hear?</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">To have no screen between this part he play’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">And him he play’d it for, he needs will be</p>
			<p class="verseline">Absolute Milan. Me, poor man-my library</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was dukedom large enough-of temporal royalties</p>
			<p class="verseline">He thinks me now incapable; confederates,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</p>
			<p class="verseline">The dukedom, yet unbow’d-alas, poor Milan!-</p>
			<p class="verseline">To most ignoble stooping.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">O the heavens!</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mark his condition, and th’ event, then tell me</p>
			<p class="verseline">If this might be a brother.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">I should sin</p>
			<p class="verseline">To think but nobly of my grandmother:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Good wombs have borne bad sons.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now the condition:</p>
			<p class="verseline">This King of Naples, being an enemy</p>
			<p class="verseline">To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which was, that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Should presently extirpate me and mine</p>
			<p class="verseline">Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan</p>
			<p class="verseline">With all the honours on my brother. Whereon,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A treacherous army levied, one midnight</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open</p>
			<p class="verseline">The gates of Milan; and, i’ th’ dead of darkness,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence</p>
			<p class="verseline">Me and thy crying self.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alack, for pity!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will cry it o’er again; it is a hint</p>
			<p class="verseline">That wrings mine eyes to’t.</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hear a little further,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And then I’ll bring thee to the present busines</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which now’s upon ‘s; without the which this story</p>
			<p class="verseline">Were most impertinent.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wherefore did they not</p>
			<p class="verseline">That hour destroy us?</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well demanded, wench!</p>
			<p class="verseline">My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So dear the love my people bore me; nor set</p>
			<p class="verseline">A mark so bloody on the business; but</p>
			<p class="verseline">With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</p>
			<p class="verseline">In few, they hurried us aboard a bark;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</p>
			<p class="verseline">A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</p>
			<p class="verseline">Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh</p>
			<p class="verseline">To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did us but loving wrong.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alack, what trouble</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was I then to you!</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, a cherubin</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou wast that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Under my burden groan’d; which rais’d in me</p>
			<p class="verseline">An undergoing stomach, to bear up</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against what should ensue.</p>
			<p class="character">Miranda</p>
			<p class="verseline">How came we ashore?</p>
			<p class="character">Prospero</p>
			<p class="verseline">By Providence divine.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Some food we had and some fresh water that</p>
			<p class="verseline">A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Out of his charity, who being then appointed</p>

			<p class="prose">Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by thunderbolt.<span class="stage_directions_inline">[Thunder]</span>Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.</p>
